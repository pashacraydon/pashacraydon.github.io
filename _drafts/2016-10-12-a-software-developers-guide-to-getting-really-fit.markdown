I have been sitting on my butt writing code all day for many years now. If you are like me, you may have become a bit overweight and have not been feeling very healthy. At least, that was me a few years ago. I've since slimmed down, then bulked up, put on a lot of strength and even developed a bit of a six pack. It feels pretty good and I thought I would share my journey and some of the tips that have helped me get this far.

# My healthy kickstart

I started noticing repetitive stress pain in my hands and wrists a few years ago from all my time on the computer. It was bad enough that I decided to join a gym and see what this whole exercise thing was all about anyway.

When I first joined a gym, I was not at all into the weight room. That was o.k. though because the gym I joined had a nice pool. Swimming everyday after work felt really great and I quickly picked up the right strokes and such to get by as a "swimmer". This gym also had yoga classes which I started attending. The swimming combined with the yoga started to really help my repetitive stress symptons. 

I happen to live in a road biking mecca in the Bay Area. I walked into a bike store then walked out with the whole she-bang, a nice new road bike, cleats, helmet, gloves, padded bike shorts. Screw it I thought, I'm gonna be a "biker".

My first year of exercise was swimming, yoga and road biking. I lost a bunch of weight and started to feel better then I had in years.

# Weight lifting

I wouldn't admit it at the time but I was bit intimitaded by the weight room. I was a scrawny computer geek. The most I had ever used my muscles was maybe carrying my laptop around.

There were some pretty "ripped" people at my gym though and it peaked by interest. Heck, I wouldn't mind being ripped myself. That seems like it could be fun.

Mostly by accident, I made friends with one of these individuals and we ended up working out together. These workout sessions doing small weights and just being introduced to the weight room gave me the confidence to spend more time in it myself. 

The rest as they say, is history. I've sort of fell in love with lifting weights and I've been doing it ever since. It feels fantastic to me after a day on the computer to hit the gym and lift some heavy weights.

### Getting strong

You don't need to be a gym rat to get fit lifting weights, in fact, it's better that you don't spend hours in the gym everyday. It's easy to "spin your wheels" so to speak in the gym, lifting the same amount of weight day-in and day-out without making any progress. You want to avoid all that. For getting really strong, I recommend the stronglifts program. It is focused around heavy barbell training and using a few core exercises that work
