I entered my thirties out of shape and over weight. I had spent most of my late teens and twenties never exercising, smoking cigarettes, not thinking much about my diet and working long hours in front of a computer writing code.

It was all catching up to me and I knew I needed to change.

I quit smoking cold turkey. It was easy because I was so disgusted with myself and the habit. I cleaned up my diet and started looking into this whole exercise thing.

For the past 5 years I've been on a fitness journey. This post is about some of the exercises I have tried and where I am today.

### Yoga

Yoga is the first exercise I got into. When I signed up to the gym for the first time, everything intimidated me so I decided to take a class. It was easy to slip into a yoga class and just listen to instructions. 

Yoga had an immediate effect on my body. It was a great way to stretch and de-stress my body after an 8 hour day spent coding in front of a computer. 

I still do it today and I highly recommend it. 

### Swimming

I chose my gym because of the nice pool it has and I am glad I did. The pool is pretty high traffic so I often need to flag someone down and ask to share a lane. 

Swimming is the best exercise when I'm injured or just hurting. I can feel everywhere in my body and notice areas of stress in my body I may not otherwise realize. The sensation of floating is addictive. 

Swimming isn't my favorite exercise but I try to hit the pool everytime I need to recoup from a lot of stress or an injury. It always makes everything better.

### Road bicycling

I live in an area in northern California which is a sort of road cycling mecca. I purchased a nice road bicycle and all the gear a couple years ago and it has been a great investment. 

Nothing burns as many calories as an hour long biking session. You also get to escape the gym and embrace the great outdoors which is a great option on nice days. 

A con is that you must deal with inconsiderate drivers who can drive too close. This has not been too much of a problem for me but it maybe different in other areas.

### Backpacking

I picked up backpacking gear about a year ago from REI. I haven't used it as much as I would like and this is something I am working on, more backpacking trips. 

I have gone on a few solo overnight adventures though. It is an excellent way to really get away from the normality of your everyday week and gain perspective. I feel very refreshed returning from these trips.

This is an excellent way to lose weight too. You can hike 6-8 hours a day and burn through thousands of calories. 

The items that have saved my butt so far include;

* A bear canister. This is a canister that can only be opened by humans so it's also useful for keeping your food safe from all animals.

* A water filtration system. You can get incredibly thirsty while hiking. Water weighs a ton so you can't and don't want to carry a lot of it on you. Thus the filtration system is used for drinking from streams along the way. 

* A pocketrocket backpacking stove for coffee and hot meals.

I was pretty stunned at all the backpacking gear in REI that is so small and lightweight. You can carry a lot of your favorite everyday comforts in a backpack.

# Strength Training

Weight lifting is my favorite form of exercise and the one I have devoted most of my time to. It is ironic that it is also the exercise I took the longest time to get into because I found it intimidating. I struck up a friendship with a "swole" individual at the gym and training with him helped me get over my insecurities.
