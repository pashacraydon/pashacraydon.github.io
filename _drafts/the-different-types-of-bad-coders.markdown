I've worked with coders of all different skill levels. I've noticed that the really great coders have a few characteristic traits that a bad coder could easily improve to become a better coder.

Here is a brief list of the traits that bad coders are stuck in and which keep them writing terrible code.

# The coder that writes unreadable code

This coder will write function and variable names that make no sense to anyone else but themselves. They also don't think that this bad practice makes very much of a difference.

A good coder knows that writing clean, readable code is the first step to a maintainable codebase that other people can productively work with. This type of bad coder doesn't understand this or think it's very important.

# The coder that doesn't write tests

This type of coder thinks tests are a waste of time.

A good coder will write tests to demonstrate how their code works, prove that it works, make it regression-proof and make it easier to extend the code in the future. 

None of these things are important to this type of coder.

# The coder that rushes through building new features

This type of coder writes code as quickly as possible because they want to be 'productive'. They probably also get rewarded for it by their project managers who tell them that they are ninjas or the sort. 

# The coder that couples many parts together

This type of coder makes it really easy to make a simple change in the codebase and unexplicably break things. This usually happens under the guise of being "DRY" or not-repeating-themselves. 

# Summary

Bad coders don't think that process is very important.
