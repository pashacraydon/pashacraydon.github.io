I winced as tree branches drove long scratches into the paint of my fairly new 2016 honda civic. I was 6 miles down a rough dirt road that was gradually getting much worse and causing me some anxiety due to the low clearance of my vehicle. In the distance rose Mount Shasta, all 14,179 feet of it. 

The last remaining members of our group, two girls, had just dropped out of the trip due to conditions on the mountain. A few winter storms had blown through the past couple of weeks and left snow on the mountain which could prove unfriendly to climbing, park rangers had warned the climbing season was over. 

It would just be me and the trip leader, Marco. I was confident enough in his previous experience with Shasta and enthusiasm for continuing the trip that I didn't back out. Besides, winter storms were expected for the following week so this was definitely the last opportunity of the year I would have to climb this mountain. 

I arrived at Clear Creek trailhead and settled in for the night in the back of my car. My alarm woke me up at 4am the following morning. Marco had arrived in the night and was already gearing up. We left our vehicles two hours later. An hour too late Marco grumbled.

We marched for three miles through fir trees with our headlamps on in the dark. The sun began to rise and light up the landscape. It was beautiful.

Past the tree line we came upon a spring. The water came bubbling straight out of the ground. This would be the last stop for water Marco warned and I topped off my two water bottles, 3 litres in total. The water was very clear, clean and nourishing.

The landscape was beginning to get much more desolate, inhabitated only by rock, ice and small trees. The trail was about to get much more difficult, Marco warned and he covered his face in a balaclava. Soon enough the trail was straight up through scree with quick elevation gain. This was a little like doing stair master on difficult and it would last for many hours, maybe 8 hours. For every three steps you move up you would slide down one. It was fairly exhausting and would really test us, particularly as the altitude started to hit.

We ran into two other travelers, a young couple. They had the erroneous idea that they would summit by noon and be back down the mountain by 4pm or so. Marco quickly corrected them. At best they wouldn't summit until at least 4pm and they would be descending in the dark. This was our goal and we were prepared for the descent with headlamps but I think it scared them and they eventually turned around before they would have to face hiking in the dark.

Marco would point out landmarks in the distance, small peaks or big boulders and cautioned me that while they appeared close, they were still many hours away. The going was rough, and slow. Very slow. It is difficult to describe just how steep and strenuous this portion was. Perhaps the following picture will suffice.

Our primary destination was red rock. A croppy boulder field of large rocks that would signal the end of this strenuous traversal in scree and begin our scamble to the top. The altitude started to hit me closer to red rock. I felt a little bit light headed like I had been given some drug at the dentist. 

I was familiar with altitude mountain sickness and I knew how dangerous it can be. I had turned around after camping at 12,000 feet on Mount Whitney the previous weekened after experiencing nausea and what I determined were the beginning symptons of altitude mountain sickness. Combined with the strenuous huffing and puffing I was beginning to feel a little anxiety about summiting. We determined that we would make it to red rock and reassess how we felt and if we wanted to continue.
