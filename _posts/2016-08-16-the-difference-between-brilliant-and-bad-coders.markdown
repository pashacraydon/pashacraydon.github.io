I've worked with coders of all different skill levels the past couple of years. I've noticed that the really great coders have a few characteristic traits that a bad coder could easily improve to become a better coder. 

# Great coders write very readable code

A bad coder is stuck in there head. They will write function and variables names that make no sense to anyone else but themselves. They also don't think that this bad practice makes very much of a difference. A great coder knows that this is baloney and that writing clean, readable code is the first step to writing code that is maintainable and other people can productively work with. 

# Great coders write tests

A bad coder thinks that tests are a waste of time. A great coder doesn't think so. A great coder will write tests to demonstrate how their code works, prove that it works, make it regression-proof, make it easier to extend the code in the future. None of this matters to a bad coder.

# Great coders are patient

A bad coder rushes through writing new code because they want to be 'productive'. They probably also get rewarded for it and their project managers tell them that they are ninjas or the sort. A great coder takes their time to write features the right way, the first time. They don't fall for the carrot-on-the-stick that is the 'productive ninja' glow of reverence a project manager may bestow for rushing features out the door.
