<p>I am a software developer living in Northern California. I write about JavaScript, software development and developer tools. Currently I write JavaScript for <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/" target="blank">O'Reilly</a> where I am building tools for online learning and reading. Previously, I did similar things at <a href="http://www.safaribooksonline.com" target="blank">Safari Books Online</a>.</p>

<p>I love adventure and the outdoors. Some of my favorite activities are rock climbing, backpacking, canyoneering and mountaineering.</p>
